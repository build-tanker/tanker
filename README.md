# Tanker

Tanker is an Open source, Self Hosted, Mobile Releases Deployment tool for iOS and Android.

*WIP : We are not ready for production yet. You can sign up for our [newsletter here](https://goo.gl/forms/Ck0lnzdWQNyfD5Il2), we will reach out to you as soon as we are ready.*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/build-tanker/tanker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/build-tanker/tanker)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/build-tanker/tanker/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/build-tanker/tanker)

## Getting Started

Tanker consists of two different components.

[Shipper](https://github.com/build-tanker/shipper), which connects to your CI or your local machine and uploads binaries. 

[Tanker](https://github.com/build-tanker/tanker), is the backend that saves binaries on Google Cloud Storage and makes it available for user's who should have access.

Please follow the instructions for both the repos.

### Prerequisites

Here are the things that you would require before you get started

1. [Install git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
1. [Install golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms), we use it both for deployment and development

### Installing

Clone the repo and build it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/build-tanker/tanker.git
make build_fresh
```

Setup postgres

```bash
$ cd external
$ docker-compose up
$ tanker migrate
repeat above till you see *Sadly, found no new migrations to run*
```

Start the binary by running tanker

```bash
tanker start
```

## Running the tests

If you would like to run the automated tests for the complete package, run this

```bash
make coverage
open ./coverage.html
```

### And coding style tests

We use the default golang coding conventions. Run the following to test for those

```bash
make fmt
make vet
make lint
```

## Code Structure

* `/bin` compiled linux and mac binaries for the project, created with `make build`
* `/cmd` create multiple binaries from the app
* `/cmd/tanker` tanker binary
* `/external` has a docker-compose for dependencies, only for local setup, provides postgres, rabbitmq and redis
* `/pkg` internal packages
* `/pkg/shippers` handle functionality for shippers (service that uploads), has handler -> service -> datastore. Handler takes care of HTTP requests, Service takes care of validations etc, Datastore takes care of persisting to DB.
* `/pkg/builds` handle functionality for builds, has handler -> service -> datastore. Handler takes care of HTTP requests, Service takes care of validations etc, Datastore takes care of persisting to DB.
* `/pkg/filestore` store physical files, filestore -> gcsfilestore -> gcs. Filestore provides an interface, GCSFileStore provides an implementation for the interface for Google Cloud, GCS handles actual google cloud functionality
* `/pkg/pings` handle functionality for pings, should ideally have handler -> service -> datastore, but given that we only response with pong, only handler is implemented
* `/pkg/appcontext` create a context with config and logger to pass through the app
* `/pkg/config` handle config for app and database
* `/pkg/filesystem` provide a layer to mock the filesystem for tiny files
* `/pkg/logger` handle logging throughout the system, provides interface over logrus
* `/pkg/postgres` handles connections to postgres and migrations
* `/pkg/postgresmock` provides a mock sqlx database
* `/pkg/responses` provides generic response and error structures and responses
* `/pkg/server` provides a new server with negroni and a router

## Deployment

We will have deployment instructions as soon as we are ready. You can sign up for our [newsletter here](https://goo.gl/forms/Ck0lnzdWQNyfD5Il2), we will reach out to you as soon as we are ready.
